# Face-Detect-ML-App
I created an Android Studio application in Java that integrates Google/Firebase Machine Learning to detect the presence of one or more faces in an image. The user clicks on the "Detect Face" button to generate a series of log messages in LogCat that state the number of faces detected. See the log messages in the image below.
